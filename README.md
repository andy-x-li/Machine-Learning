A collection of Machine Learning Projects from my time at University.

Kernel Regression is a technique used in machine learning to address the nonlinearity present in some datasets. In `python Kernel_Regression.py`, I used a Gaussian kernel to train a kernel ridge regression classifier (K). K is calculated using the following equation:

We can use the following equation to estimate Î±:
