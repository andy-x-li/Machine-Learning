# Machine-Learning
A collection of Machine Learning Projects from my time at University.

Kernel Regression is a technique used in machine learning to address the nonlinearity present in some datasets. In `python Kernel_Regression.py`, I used a Gaussian kernel to train a kernel ridge regression classifier (K). K is calculated using the following equation:

We can use the following equation to estimate Î±:

To run this code: <br>
> **1)** Run via cmd line `python Kernel_Regression.py` <br>
> **2)** One-by-one, observe the graphs that pop up

Notes: The first window you will see displays two graphs side by side that are almost identical. The graph on the left represents the training data we randomly generated. The graph on the right represents the data predicted by our model. The next window will show this
